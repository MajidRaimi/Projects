    "# Python Programming: Final Project\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, I want to congratulate you for making it this far! We know we've packed a lot of knowledge into a relatively short time! All of you did a great job!\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "I would like you to have something tangible to show off from this amazing course, so let's use your newly acquired skills in this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you are going to work with a very famous and real dataset on [Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic)](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data/data). The dataset is available on kaggle and originally belong to [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Diagnostic%29).<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deliverables\n",
    "\n",
    "You are encouraged to work in groups (ideal size of a group is 3). Each group has to present their finding and they will be given 10 mins to talk. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "Your final presentation **must** include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data  exploration\n",
    "    - Get creative and apply data exploration in order to retrieve meaningful and correct information. Think how the features are helping to diagnose the type of cancer. Use summary statistics and explore the data to understand other potential measures. \n",
    "2. Data displayed in a minimum of 5 different visualizations.\n",
    "    - Take care that they're the best choice of visualizations for the data and are easy to comprehend. Use appropriate labels.\n",
    "3. Cleaning the data â€” handling of NULL values or other potential errors in the data.\n",
    "4. Core Python topics. At minimum:\n",
    "      - Dictionaries *or* sets *or* tuples (if needed).\n",
    "      - Using of different libraries: Numpy, Pandas, matplotlib, seaborn etc\n",
    "      - Basic debugging, such as a `try-except` block *(only if necessary)*.\n",
    "      - Use list comprehension, lambda expression and functions (if needed).\n",
    "      - User input *or* reading from a file.\n",
    "5. Comments ate very important, so another team member can easily see what you have done, well documented projects are always appreciated.\n",
    "6. Python style and DocString style at appropriate places.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Resources\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Suggested Ways to Get Started\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Begin with the end in mind.** Know where you want to go by planning ahead. Define the problem and don't waste time building things you don't need. [Here is the information on your dataset on kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data)  \n",
    "* **Read the docs** for whatever technologies or datasets you use. Most of the time, there is a tutorial that you can follow! This isn't always the case, however, learning to read documentation is crucial to your success as a developer.\n",
    "* **Write `pseudocode` before you write actual code.** Take a pen and paper, thinking through the logic of something is always helpful.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Additional Resources\n",
    "\n",
    "- An [extremely helpful debugging flowchart](https://www.dropbox.com/s/cqsxfws52gulkyx/drawing.pdf).\n",
    "- The [Python Docs](https://docs.python.org).\n",
    "- [Keyword `args`](http://treyhunner.com/2018/04/keyword-arguments-in-python/).\n",
    "- [`args` and `kwargs`](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-args-and-kwargs-in-python-3).\n",
    "- [Sets on a Python Tutorial Website](https://www.learnpython.org/en/Sets)).\n",
    "- [Tuples](http://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/python/english3e/tuples.html).\n",

    "## Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "Your project will be evaluated based on the rubric below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rubric\n",
    "\n",
    "| Score | Expectations |\n",
    "| ----- | ---------------------------------------------------- |\n",
    "| 0 | Incomplete. |\n",
    "| 1 | Does not meet expectations. |\n",
    "| 2 | Meets expectations, good job! |\n",
    "| 3 | Exceeds expectations, you wonderful creature, you! |\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A zero-to-three grading scale may not intuitively make sense, so here is an example using the criteria as if your assignment were to cook a pizza:\n",
    "\n",
    "Criteria | **0** Incomplete. | **1** Does not meet expectations. | **2** Meets expectations. | **3**  Exceeds expectations. |\n",
    ":--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :---\n",
    "Crust | No crust present. Submission is just cheese and sauce on a plate. | Pizza has a crust, but it is raw. | Crust is cooked thoroughly.| Crust is golden brown and just thin enough without being too thick.\n",
    "Cheese | No cheese present. | Cheese is made of soy. | Cheese covers the pizza from edge to edge. | Cheese is delicious, plentiful, and melted to perfection."
