# Python

This section includes all courses and projects I have worked on using python. This includes:

- GPA Calculator App.
- Deep Learning Algorithms.
- Mobile Application using Kivy
- General Purpose Projects.

## Courses

These are various courses I have taken when learning python independently. These include:

- [CS50](courses/cs50/) and [CS50 AI](courses/CS50%20AI/)
- [Data Science with Python](courses/Data%20Science%20Course/) by MiSK Academy.
- [KAUST introduction to Deep Learning](courses/KAUST%20AI/).

Each of these courses has its own projects and programs that helped me improve my python knowledge drastically.

## General Projects

These are projects that I have worked on independently. These include:

- My [GPA Calculator](General%20Projects/GPA%20Calculator/) made from Scratch to help me keep track of university GPA. Uses Web Scraping to fill up the database directly from the university website.
- My [VoiceBot](General%20Projects/Voice%20Bot/) which I have used to recognize when my name is called and tell the caller that I am available.
- [Property Map](General%20Projects/Property%20Map%20VIew/) View which is a mobile application I have worked on in collaboration with my friend for a python real estate competition.
