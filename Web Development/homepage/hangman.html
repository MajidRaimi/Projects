                The origins of the game are unclear but could stretch back to the 1890s. Players guess letters of an unrevealed word and then draw an arm, 
                leg, head or torso of a stick figure hanging from gallows for every incorrect guess. If players draw all body parts and the word still hasn't 
                been spelled out, the players lose.

            The word to guess is represented by a row of dashes, representing each letter of the word. In most variants, proper nouns, 
            such as names, places, and brands, are not allowed. Slang words, sometimes referred to as informal or shortened words, are also not allowed. 
            If the guessing player suggests a letter which occurs in the word, the other player writes it in all its correct positions. 
            If the suggested letter does not occur in the word, the other player draws one element of a hanged man stick figure as a tally mark.<br><br>

            The player guessing the word may, at any time, attempt to guess the whole word. If the word is correct, the game is over and the guesser wins. 
            Otherwise, the other player may choose to penalize the guesser by adding an element to the diagram. On the other hand, if the other player makes 
            enough incorrect guesses to allow his opponent to complete the diagram, the game is also over, this time with the guesser losing. However, the 
            guesser can also win by guessing all the letters that appear in the word, thereby completing the word, before the diagram is completed.

            As the name of the game suggests, the diagram is designed to look like a hanging man. Although debates have arisen about the game, it is still in use today. 
            A common alternative for teachers is to draw an apple tree with ten apples, erasing or crossing out the apples as the guesses are used up.<br><br>

            The exact nature of the diagram differs; some players draw the gallows before play and draw parts of the man's body (traditionally the head, then the torso, 
            then the arms and legs one by one). Some players begin with no diagram at all, and drawing the individual elements of the gallows as part of the game, 
            effectively giving the guessing players more chances. The amount of detail on the man can also vary, affecting the number of chances. Some players include a 
            face on the head, either all at once or one feature at a time. Some players include beheading the head as the last chance by drawing a line at the neck.<br><br>
            
            Some modifications to game play (house rules) to increase the difficulty level are sometimes implemented, such as limiting guesses on high-frequency consonants 
            and vowels. Another alternative is to give the definition of the word; this can be used to facilitate the learning of a foreign language.
