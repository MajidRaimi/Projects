                What is CrossPlay?

                    In video games with online gaming functionality, Also, cross-compatible or cross-platform play, crossplay, 
                    or cross-play describes the ability of players using different video game hardware to play with each other simultaneously. 
                    It is commonly applied to the ability for players using a game on a specific video game console to play alongside a player on a 
                    different hardware platform such as another console or a computer. A related concept is cross-save, where the player's progress in a 
                    game is stored in separate servers, and can be continued in the game but on a different hardware platform.<br><br>

                    In other words, CrossPlay gives gamers the ability to play a specific game on multiple platforms. CrossPlay compatible games include fortnite, 
                    OverWatch, Destiny, and many more. However, it is still not enough games to fully realize this CrossPlay dream. We need to think bigger. In reality, 
                    all games can be CrossPlay Compatible, we just need companies to listen to their customers and actually implement that feature for all their 
                    popular titles.

            Well, I've decided to include some interesting facts about classic games that genuinely unite gamers worldwide. Naturally, these games are pretty much known to everyone 
            very loosely, and can be played whenever and wherever you are. These games are classic and are some amazing examples of how games unite people no matter their
            culture, background, or ethnicity. These examples are why we should strive for much better gaming environments for all gamers.
